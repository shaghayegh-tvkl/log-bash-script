# HAProxy Log Analyser

In this script, HAProcy log files are analysed and http request codes are devided into three categories. The result would return the number of 2xx, 4xx, and 5xx status codes.
To run the script, clone the project on a Debian-based OS and run this command:

`sudo ./log-analysis/analyze`

You would be prompted to enter a start date for reports in YYYY-MM-DD format followed by the number of reports.
